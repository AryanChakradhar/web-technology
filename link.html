        <p>You People is a 2023 American romantic comedy film directed by Kenya Barris, which he co-wrote with Jonah Hill. The film features an ensemble cast that includes Hill, Lauren London, David Duchovny, Nia Long, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, and Eddie Murphy. Its plot focuses on an interracial and interreligious couple, namely a white Jewish man and a Black Muslim woman, and how their families reckon with modern love amid culture clashes, societal expectations and generational differences. Set in the Los Angeles area, two Millennials meet by chance and go into uncharted waters in their dating lives.

            You People was released in select theaters on January 20, 2023, before its Netflix streaming release on January 27. It was the first time Barris directed a feature film. The film received mixed-to-negative reviews from critics and has stirred questions of anti-semitism.</p>

            <p>You know, the ones who wrote all the cliched nonsense with the shallow dialogue, in attempt to make a social satirical rom-com, that ended up flopping miserably. And those that failed to direct the all-star cast properly, so they all ended up being unconvincing in everything they did and said.

                I've seen failed SNL sketches with better execution, more urgency in the acting, with coherent and cohesive dialogue. But instead, those people gave us a long, dragged out, boring and shallow blah-blah commentary, with zero laughs, that will have you struggle to stay awake in this predictable sloth-paced nonsense.
                
                Such a waste of a talented cast. This is one of those films that is more annoying than entertaining, and aside from the predictable romance as the core of the film, everything else is just forced, feels phony, and flops from every angle. I can't even suggest it's a decent one-time watch, because I feel like I've wasted 2 hours I'll never get back.</p>
